(** E-node.

      An e-node is a node in the congruence closure that is contained
      in some equivalence classe).
      An equivalence class is a set of terms that are currently equal
      in the partial model built by the solver.
      The class is represented by a collection of nodes, one of which is
      distinguished and is called the "representative".

      All information pertaining to the whole equivalence class is stored
      in its representative's {!E_node.t}.

      When two classes become equal (are "merged"), one of the two
      representatives is picked as the representative of the new class.
      The new class contains the union of the two old classes' nodes.

      We also allow theories to store additional information in the
      representative. This information can be used when two classes are
      merged, to detect conflicts and solve equations Ã  la Shostak.
