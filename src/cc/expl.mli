      when asked to justify why two terms are equal. *)

(** [mk_theory t u expl_sets pr] builds a theory explanation for
    why [|- t=u]. It depends on sub-explanations [expl_sets] which
    are tuples [ (t_i, u_i, expls_i) ] where [expls_i] are
    explanations that justify [t_i = u_i] in the current congruence closure.

    The proof [pr] is the theory lemma, of the form
    [ (t_i = u_i)_i |- t=u ].
    It is resolved against each [expls_i |- t_i=u_i] obtained from
    [expl_sets], on pivot [t_i=u_i], to obtain a proof of [Gamma |- t=u]
    where [Gamma] is a subset of the literals asserted into the congruence
    closure.

    For example for the lemma [a=b] deduced by injectivity
    from [Some a=Some b] in the theory of datatypes,
    the arguments would be
    [a, b, [Some a, Some b, mk_merge_t (Some a)(Some b)], pr]
    where [pr] is the injectivity lemma [Some a=Some b |- a=b].
