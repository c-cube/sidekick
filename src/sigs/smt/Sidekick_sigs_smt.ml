(** Signature for the main SMT solver types.

    Theories and concrete solvers rely on an environment that defines
    several important types:

    - sorts
    - terms (to represent logic expressions and formulas)
    - a congruence closure instance
    - a bridge to some SAT solver

    In this module we collect signatures defined elsewhere and define
    the module types for the main SMT solver.

      and some additional views on terms, literals, etc.
      that are specific to the theory (e.g. to map terms to linear
      expressions).
      The theory can then be instantiated on any kind of solver for any
      term representation that also satisfies the additional theory-specific
