(** [claim_term self ~th_id t] means that theory with ID [th_id]
    claims the term [t].

    This means it might assert [t = u] or [t â‰  u] for some other term [u],
    or it might assign a value to [t] in the model in case of a SAT answer.
    That means it has to agree with other theories on what [t] is equal to.

    If a term is claimed by several theories, it will be eligible for theory
    combination.
