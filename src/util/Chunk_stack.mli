(** Manage a list of chunks.

    A chunk is used for serializing proof traces, possibly on disk.
    This way we do not have to keep the whole proof in memory.
    Each chunk is typically one step of the proof search.

    We produce chunks in forward order (chronological order of their discovery),
    but once we find a proof of "false", we work our way backward to find
    chunks transitively needed by this proof of false.
    Once we obtain this subset of the chunks (as a graph in memory) we can
    emit a proper proof with no redundant information.
